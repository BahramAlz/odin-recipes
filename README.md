A simple recipe website for the purpose of learning, highlighting the different HTML elements, tags, attributes and capabilities. Also Git usage according to the 7 rules of a great Git commit message.

All images, text, recipes can be found @https://www.ica.se/recept/enkel/middag/
Since I'm bad at cooking, I used the Swedish website of ICA for recipes, all I did was translate the text to English and use the images.
